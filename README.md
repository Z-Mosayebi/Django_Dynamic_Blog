# Elevate Project

Elevate is a Django-based web application designed to showcase dynamic content management through a blog-style interface. It includes an app named **Lynx**, which allows users to view individual articles dynamically from a database.

### Features

- **Template Views**: The project includes a main page listing all articles and a detail page for individual articles.
- **Bootstrap Styling**: Basic Bootstrap styling is used to format the article list and detail view.

### Usage
